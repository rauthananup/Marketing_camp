# About Dataset
A response model can provide a significant boost to the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenses. The objective is to predict who will respond to an offer for a product or service

# Business Problem: 
Marketing Campaigns are a vital part of how company's promote their interests, whether that be raising awareness for a new product or capturing customer feedback. That's why it's important for the data analysts of any company to be able to gauge customer's participation in the marketing campaigns, assess the success of past campaigns, and propose data-driven solutions to increase participation in future campaigns.
Our objective is to provide a complete analysis of the behaviour of the customers and understand target audience that would respond better to the campaigns.

# Insight

ðŸ“Œ The Response on last campaign of 334 (around 15%) people out of 2240 Accepted Offer.

ðŸ“Œ Campaign 4 is the winning campaign, campaign 2 received poor results.

ðŸ“Œ Campaign 3 seems to be very attractive to customers with basic education.

ðŸ“Œ Our customers spend the most on wine by far, followed by meat.

ðŸ“Œ Customers with no kids tend to spend a lot on wine and Customers with no kids tend to spend a lot on wine.

ðŸ“Œ Customers with 1-2 kids or teens at home really liked campaign 3.

ðŸ“Œ Customers with teens (at least one) at home really appreciated campaign 4 and customers with no teen or at least one at home really appreciated campaign 5.

# Conclusions of the EDA

ðŸ“Œ A large portion of our customers have at least a Master's degree

ðŸ“Œ Higher education level seems to be correlated to higher income Which makes me wonder if we as a business is not affordable for lower income customers.

ðŸ“Œ Customers with no kids seem to have higher income, which means that they might fit our targeted profile better.

ðŸ“Œ As a result, it might make sense for us to figure out how to tap into their disposable income (that they have no kids to spend on!) with our campaigns
   Finally one thought on recency, I didn't find any correlation between any campaign and recency But I think potential future campaigns that get inactive        customers making purchases could be interesting.
